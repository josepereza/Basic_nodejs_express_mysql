# Project Title

NodeJs CRUD operation.

I have created web appliaction i.e CRUD operation using NodeJs,ExpressJs,Mysql,EJS(for templating engine).

## Getting Started

Step to follow to created your first CRUD operation using node.

1.Nodejs has to be installed in your system.

2.If NodeJs is installed check it using this command (if it returned something like v8.11.1) that means its installed perfectlly
```
	node -v
```
	
3.Create project folder 

4.Now go to your project folder inside that you need to install some packages using npm command

5.open terminal and go to project path and run 
```
	npm install
```
6.It will install all the required packages from packages.json file 	

7.Create your database and configure it inside (You will find database name,host ,username change is accordingly )
```
	index.js 
```	
## Running the tests

8.Once you have done thses configuration run this command in terminal
```
	nodemon index.js
```		
9.Once you run you will get port number on which your node crud will run something like localhost:3000

10.Once you get port number open browser and run your project using port number like
```
	localhost:3200
```	
	
	Finally you are running you first NodeJs project.
